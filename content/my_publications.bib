  abstract = {There is a need to develop an assisting device which can be adapted to the individual capabilities of elderly attendants, which would allow them to maintain a level of fitness when pushing a wheelchair, while minimising the risk of injury to them. Furthermore there is a need to reduce the overall energy consumption of the device in keeping with the current trends of reducing carbon emissions. The control system for attendants pushing wheelchairs that reduces the energy needed by the assisting device is an increasing trend of optimisation of assistive technology devices to individual capabilities to ensure less energy expenditure of the attendant. The control parameters for existing assisting systems for attendant wheelchair propulsion are difficult to optimise for individual capabilities. We focus on the individual propelling performance, and propose an assisting control method based on the force velocity relationship of the individual. Our proposed assisting controller generates an assisting force when the attendant's propelling force exceeds an assisting boundary defined by the force velocity relationship. In this paper, we tested the performance of the assisting controller based on force velocity (FV) relationship using simulation. The simulation used an attendant wheelchair model with parameters determined from experiments. From the simulated results of the assisting force trajectories, the FV assisting system worked as we defined. The FV assisting system used less energy consumption than the existing proportional assisting systems. Also the FV assisting system would have a limit of maximum attendant propelling power, so the distribution between the attendant force and the assisting force can be easily adjusted to the individual's force velocity relationship. Our proposed FV assisting system would be useful as it would allow an optimised system based on individual capabilities to be created for rehabilitation/training systems, which would allow optimum energy consumption when propelling a wheelchair.},

  abstract = {Amartya Sen’s seminal Tanner lecture: Equality of What? began a contestation on social justice and human wellbeing that saw a new human development paradigm emerge—the capability approach (CA)—which has been influential ever since. Following interviews with leading global assistive technology (AT) stakeholders, and users, this paper takes inspiration from Sen’s core question and posits, AT for what? arguing that AT should be understood as a mechanism to achieve the things that AT users’ value. Significantly, our research found no commonly agreed operational global framework for (disability) justice within which leading AT stakeholders were operating. Instead, actors were loosely aligned through funding priorities and the CRPD. We suggest that this raises the possibility for (welcome and needed) incoming actors to diverge from efficiently designed collective action, due to perverse incentives enabled by unanchored interventions. The Global Report on Assistive Technology (GReAT) helps, greatly! However, we find there are still vital gaps in coordination; as technology advances, and AT proliferates, no longer can the device-plus-service approach suffice. Rather, those of us interested in human flourishing might explore locating AT access within an operational global framework for disability justice, which recognizes AT as a mechanism to achieve broader aims, linked to people’s capabilities to choose what they can do and be.},

Yet little is understood about access for the poorest, or the potential of AT to enable this group to participate in the activities of citizenship; both formal and informal. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore AT as mediator of participation in citizenship for persons with disabilities who live in two informal settlements in Freetown, Sierra Leone (SL). The paper presents evidence from 16 participant and 5 stakeholder interviews; 5 focus groups and 4 events; combining this with the findings of a house-to-house AT survey; and two national studies—a country capacity assessment and an informal markets deep-dive. Despite citizenship activities being valued, a lack of AT was consistently reported and hindered participation. Stigma was also found to be a major barrier. AT access for the poorest must be addressed if citizenship participation for persons with disabilities is a genuine global intention and disability justice is to become a reality.}

However, the model used to design and deliver disability inclusion for London 2012, and its legacy, has never been explicitly written up. This paper presents new primary evidence from first-hand research from those who were involved; retrospectively framing the London 2012 Disability Inclusion Model such that it might be usable and developed for other global disability challenges. We used an adapted Delphi methodology, through four rounds: beginning with an initial hypothesis and testing through semi-structured interviews with ten key players in the London 2012 disability inclusion approach. Using thematic analysis with consensus building surveys and workshops we came to a settled unanimous agreement on the 12-step London 2012 Disability Inclusion Model comprising three parts: (Get ready) community-led mission setting, (Get set) essential building blocks and (Go) enabling a culture of success. The model is presented here, alongside a narrative on its uniqueness and replicability to other major programs, as a public good. We welcome its active use, testing and adaption by others in service of disability innovation for a fairer world.},

The aim is to better understand how we can re-think the senses in technology design for disability interactions and the dynamic self, constructed through continuously changing sensing capabilities either because of changing ability or because of the empowering technology.

Novel technologies such as the thermoplastic Confidence Socket are emerging, which could help facilitate easier access to prosthetic services. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the satisfaction and the performance of transtibial prosthesis featuring the Confidence Socket. STUDY DESIGN: This is a longitudinal repeated-measures design study. METHODS: A convenience sample of 26 participants who underwent transtibial amputation were fitted with the Confidence Socket. The performance of the socket was evaluated after a follow-up period between 1 month and 6 months using the L test of functional mobility and the amputee mobility predictor. Satisfaction with the prosthesis was measured using the Trinity Amputation and Prosthetic Experience Scales and purposefully designed 7-point Likert scales. RESULTS: Ten of the 26 participants returned for follow-up. Perceived activity restriction and L test times improved significantly at follow-up, but the self-reported satisfaction with the Confidence Socket was lower at follow-up compared with that after fitting. CONCLUSIONS: The Amparo Confidence Socket represents a potentially viable alternative to improve access to appropriate prosthesis in Kenya, but some aspects of users' self-reported satisfaction should be further investigated.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Transferring to and from the wheelchair is among the most important routine tasks for many wheelchair users. Transfers are also greatly affected by many personal and external factors. The purpose of this study is to investigate personal experiences, needs and concerns of wheelchair users in relation to wheelchair transfers performed in their everyday lives. METHODS: A series of focus groups and interviews were carried out with 11 wheelchair users and 4 occupational therapists. Data were analysed using a hybrid deductive and inductive approach of thematic analysis. RESULTS: The seven themes identified emphasize the importance and complexity of wheelchair transfers. Transfers were described as gateways to independence that grant access to life opportunities, and community participation. Nonetheless, transferring skills are difficult to acquire and the concept of correct technique, although really important, is often poorly defined. Wheelchair transfers can be further complicated by the characteristics of the individual, the presence of upper limb pain, fear of falling or the characteristics of the environment. Despite the importance of transfer training to improve safety and reduce the risk of overload injuries, only a few people receive dedicated advice from health professionals. Currently available assistive technologies were perceived as only partially successful in providing support to wheelchair users during the execution of transfers, especially when environmental constraints make the transfer more challenging. CONCLUSION: Due to their multifactorial nature, creating effective solutions to improve any aspect of wheelchair transfers will require a collaborative effort from users, clinicians, designers and other professionals. Implications for rehabilitation The ability to transfer independently is extremely important for many wheelchair users and can affect not only their personal and social lives, but also the way they perceive themselves and are perceived by others. The use of a correct transferring technique plays an important role in reducing the effort required to complete a transfer and decreases the risk factors for both falls and upper limb injury development. Unfortunately, few wheelchair users have access to in-person training to develop transferring skills. The remaining people rely on a combination of peer observation, personal research and simple trial and error to figure out the movement strategies that better suit their needs. Currently available assistive technologies are perceived by wheelchair users as only partially successful in providing support during the execution of transfers. Transfer boards and other devices are often described as only useful for basic transfers and for individuals with reduced, but still sufficient, upper limb function.},

People who require the use of a powered wheelchair or a mobility scooter in order to be able to carry out their daily activities are most likely to experience transport disadvantage, primarily due to architectural barriers present within the network that limit accessibility. Formulation of new policies is of primary importance to increase the transport network accessibility. Policy-making and evaluation are often based mainly on qualitative approaches. Although this can give a good appreciation of the users prospective, it fails to consider the more global impact that new and existing policies can have. The use of big datasets from automated fare collection systems could improve this aspect, allowing for a more quantitative approach to measuring accessibility measures. Furthermore these datasets could benefit from a more disaggregated classification to help categorise travel patterns and behaviour specific to wheelchairs and mobility scooter users},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Transfers are an important skill for many wheelchair users (WU). However, they have also been related to the risk of falling or developing upper limb injuries. Transfer abilities are usually evaluated in clinical settings or biomechanics laboratories, and these methods of assessment are poorly suited to evaluation in real and unconstrained world settings where transfers take place. OBJECTIVE The objective of this paper is to test the feasibility of a system based on a wearable low-cost sensor to monitor transfer skills in real-world settings. METHODS We collected data from 9 WU wearing triaxial accelerometer on their chest while performing transfers to and from car seats and home furniture. We then extracted significant features from accelerometer data based on biomechanical considerations and previous relevant literature and used machine learning algorithms to evaluate the performance of wheelchair transfers and detect their occurrence from a continuous time series of data. RESULTS Results show a good predictive accuracy of support vector machine classifiers when determining the use of head-hip relationship (75.9\%) and smoothness of landing (79.6\%) when the starting and ending of the transfer are known. Automatic transfer detection reaches performances that are similar to state of the art in this context (multinomial logistic regression accuracy 87.8\%). However, we achieve these results using only a single sensor and collecting data in a more ecological manner. CONCLUSIONS The use of a single chest-placed accelerometer shows good predictive accuracy for algorithms applied independently to both transfer evaluation and monitoring. This points to the opportunity for designing ubiquitous-technology based personalized skill development interventions for WU. However, monitoring transfers still require the use of external inputs or extra sensors to identify the start and end of the transfer, which is needed to perform an accurate evaluation.}

  abstract = {Most research which investigates stigma towards with people with disabilities and the use of Assistive Technology (AT) are based in the Global North and focus on the experiences of people with disabilities and the consequences that stigma has on choices surrounding AT. However, stigma is a societal construct rooted in the attitude and beliefs that people without disabilities hold on disability and AT. Furthermore, the portrayal of people with disabilities and AT is dependent on the social context. In this paper, we examine how young Kenyans without disabilities view people with disabilities and AT users. Findings show that while the portrayal of disability is often shaped by negative emotion, participants felt that many of the barriers affecting people with disabilities were created by society. Perceptions of AT differed-devices were not only seen as a mark of disability but also as a sign of access to resources. Therefore, what we see is an emergent picture where social barriers can be reinforced by poverty, and where poverty reinforces social barriers faced by people with disabilities. We conclude that access to appropriate technology alongside societal interventions tackling incorrect beliefs about disability can help to overcome the stigma faced by people with disabilities.},

  abstract = {Disability stigma in many low-and middle-income countries represents one of the most pervasive barriers preventing people with disabilities from accessing equal rights and opportunities, including the uptake of available assistive technology (AT). Previous studies have rarely examined how disability stigma may be shaped through factors endemic to social interactions, including how the use of assistive technology itself may precipitate or alleviate disability stigma. Through two strands of work, we address this gap. Via a series of focus groups with Kenyans without disabilities (Study 1) and secondary data analysis of consultations with Kenyans with disabilities and their allies (Study 2), we identify shared and divergent understandings of what shapes disability stigma and discrimination. Specifically, Kenyans with and without disabilities were cognizant of how religious/spiritual interpretations of disability, conceptions of impairments as “different” from the norm, and social stereotypes about (dis)ability shaped the experience of stigma and discrimination. Moreover, both groups highlighted assistive technology as an influential factor that served to identify or “mark” someone as having a disability. However, whereas participants without disabilities saw assistive technology purely as an enabler to overcome stigma, participants with disabilities also noted that, in some cases, use of assistive technologies would attract stigma from others.}

The paper presents an initial taxonomy of noise in runners’ voice self-reports data via eSense.  This is based on a qualitative analysis of voice recordings based on eSense’s microphone with 11 runners across 14 in-the-wild running sessions.  The paper discusses the details and characteristics of the observed noise, the challenges in achieving good-quality self-reports, and opportunities for extracting useful contextual information. The paper further suggests a noise-categorization API for the eSense or other similar platforms, not only for the purpose of noise-cancellation but also incorporating the mining of contextual information.},

  abstract = {The relationships between environmental features and older people’s ability to safely move around a complex pedestrian environment are, as yet, poorly understood. Specifically, the impact of light levels on trip hazard detection during walking has received relatively little attention. This study investigates the effect of illuminance on people’s ability to detect steps of different heights in a laboratory-based controlled environment. Sixteen young and 15 older participants walked along a 13.2 m walkway towards an either ascending or descending step at 200 lux or 4 lux light levels. Trial time, gaze behaviour and distance at which the step was first visually fixated (detection distance) were measured using an eye-tracker. It was found that both the trial time and detection distance of older participants were affected by light level whereas the fixation number and fixation duration of young participants were affected by step-height. Shorter detection distance, greater number of fixations and longer fixation duration were found among older participants as opposed to young participants. The results suggest that the processing efficiency for visual information on an upcoming step is slower among older people than among young people. This implies that the vulnerability of older pedestrians maybe be reduced if better lighting or a simplified visual environment is provided.}

  abstract = {Walking in the footway environment is an essential activity of daily living and the physical activity associated can also improve an individual’s quality of life. The possibility and ability for the individual to reach opportunities and participate in activities on foot indicate the accessibility of the footway environment. One of the major hazards in the footway environment that impedes the accessibility is falling. While it may happen to anyone, falling is more common in older people and the consequence of falling could seriously deteriorate their quality of life. Falls among older people is one of the major public health problems. Fall-induced injuries, either physical or psychological, can lead to further physical frailty and social isolation. Although falls study on the elderly has been widely discussed, there is little information available on risk factors in the outdoor footway environment. The current guidance of design and condition of footway environment, however, is short of scientific justification. The potential hazard of a single step-height, such as defects and kerbs on the pavement, is commonly encountered as well as negotiated by the individual under different lighting conditions. Therefore, a framework within which the interaction among sensory and physical capability and environmental factors could be well investigated is needed. This thesis investigates the process of planning for negotiating upcoming step-heights on the pavement, and aims at establishing changes in gaze (where people look) and gait (how people walk) behaviour in relation to combinations of environmental factors such as step-heights and lighting levels. About 17 young (aged 25-34) and 17 older (aged 65-74) participants walked on a straight walkway with 16 experimental conditions (8 step-heights at 2 lighting levels, one step-height in each environmental setting), and the visual and walking patterns were collected. The results demonstrated the inconspicuous descending step-heights (due to a lack of visibility) as well as the lower lighting level demanded additional visual attention and additional time to plan footsteps. Step-height of 60 mm was found to be the threshold of sensory as well as physical capability, which should be considered as suggested guideline for pavement design. Both 125 and 30 mm were perceived as VI more dangerous due in part to additional body function requirement and the nature of visual ambiguity respectively. More importantly, young participants demonstrated the agility and adaptability to different environmental setting whereas older people demonstrated more disturbed gait pattern and increased visual attention. Also, older people were more likely to face the risk of falling as they detected the step-heights later, had shorter time for response than young participants. Therefore in footway design, older people’s perception as well as reaction to response to the footway environment should be considered and the pavement should be designed to accommodate their needs. Bringing together the gaze and gait analysis is proved to be important in this thesis and it is essential for further research in understanding the cognitive process in between. The responses to risks of falling could not be understood without knowing the association between the visual perception and gait adjustments. The approach developed in this thesis might be used to further analyse microscopic as well as macroscopic scales of accessibility of the footway environment and provide some insights into how the individual’s sensory, cognitive and physical capability affect the decision making process while walking.},

Critical to meeting this need trajectory is understanding AT access in older ages. Yet few publications examine this from a longitudinal perspective. This review aims to identify and collate what data exist globally, seeking all population-based cohorts and repeated cross-sectional surveys through the Maelstrom Research Catalogue (searched May 10, 2022) and the Disability Data Report (published 2022), respectively. Datasets incorporating functional limitations modules and question(s) dedicated to AT, with a wave of data collection since 2009, were included. Of 81 cohorts and 202 surveys identified, 47 and 62 meet inclusion criteria, respectively. Over 40\% of cohorts were drawn from high-income countries which have already experienced significant population ageing. Cohorts often exclude participants based on pre-existing support needs. For surveys, Africa is the most represented region (40\%). Globally, 73\% of waves were conducted since 2016. 'Use' is the most collected AT access indicator (69\% of cohorts and 85\% of surveys). Glasses (78\%) and hearing aids (77\%) are the most represented AT. While gaps in data coverage and representation are significant, collating existing datasets highlights current opportunities for analyses and methods for improving data collection across the sector.},

The methods used to collect AP population-level market data are similarly varied. In this paper, we review current population-level AP supply and demand estimation methods for five priority APs and provide recommendations for improving national and global AP market evaluation. Abstracts resulting from a systematic search were double-screened. Extracted data include WHO world region, publication year, age-groups, AP domain(s), study method, and individual assessment approach. 497 records were identified. Vision-related APs comprised 65\% (n = 321 studies) of the body of literature; hearing (n = 59), mobility (n = 24), cognitive (n = 2), and studies measuring multiple domains (n = 92) were proportionately underrepresented. To assess individual AP need, 4 unique approaches were identified among 392 abstracts; 45\% (n = 177) used self-report and 84\% (n = 334) used clinical evaluation. Study methods were categorized among 431 abstracts; Cross-sectional studies (n = 312, 72\%) and secondary analyses of cross-sectional data (n = 61, 14\%) were most common. Case studies illustrating all methods are provided. Employing approaches and methods in the contexts where they are most well-suited to generate standardized AP indicators will be critical to further develop comparable population-level research informing supply and demand, ultimately expanding sustainable access to APs.},

  abstract = {Platform Edge Doors (PEDs) are becoming an international benchmark for metro systems because of their potential to facilitate the transition to fully automated train operation and to reduce the social and operating costs of accidents and obstacles on the platform train interface (PTI). However, concerns exist that the presence of PEDs may lengthen the dwell time, which can severely hinder service reliability in high-frequency services such as those operated by London Underground (LU). This paper explores the impact of PEDs on the boarding and alighting time (BAT) and on passenger behaviour from two perspectives: through laboratory experiments under controlled conditions and through the analysis of video footage recorded on LU network. Both approaches lead to similar conclusions, showing that the presence of PEDs does not have a negative impact on the BAT and does affect passenger behaviour at the platform, inducing a more organised boarding and alighting process where boarders wait beside the door rather than in front of them and give way to alighters more often than without PEDs.},

  abstract = {Measuring how difficult access is for people is important in order to achieve inclusive access for all. One practical and effective way of measuring difficulty in people’s access is to track how they move around in a given environment. However, systems for tracking people are often costly and complicated to use. This article concerns the development and application of a low cost computer vision-based tracking system called MoRe-T2 (mobility research trajectory tracker). MoRe-T2 can be used to quickly characterize the trajectories people make under different conditions (e.g. when using a wheelchair, exiting through a train’s sliding doors, approaching a ramp or moving through crowded environments). A MoRe-T2 system uses video cameras such as a webcam to track the pose of QR-code-like markers. MoRe-T2 markers enable orientation as an extra level of tracking information and they uniquely identify many participants. Both of these features of a marker are unavailable in markers of more standard techniques for video tracking like ‘blob’ detection (i.e. simply tracking a blob of a certain colour for example). These markers can be simply printed onto paper and can then be attached to people or assistive technologies, such as a wheelchair and a scooter. The MoRe-T2 cameras are time- synchronized and are mounted so that at any given time every marker in the experiment area is visible to at least one camera. In a simple process, the cameras’ positions can be sufficiently estimated automatically using a single marker. Videos of the scene are recorded and afterwards, the recorded videos are processed with the cameras’ estimated position using software called ARToolkitPlus library. This software calculates the position and orientation of markers with respect to the cameras. The end result is a detailed map describing the time-locked trajectories plotted on a 3D time independent plane.},

Several exoskeletons have been developed to restore functional movements, such as walking, for those with paralysis due to neurological impairment. However, existing exoskeletons have limitations with respect to affordability, size, weight, speed, and efficiency, which may reduce their functional application. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review is to collect and narratively synthesize the perspectives of users of exoskeleton technology.A systematic literature search was conducted across several healthcare related online databases.A total of 4,619 articles were identified, of which 51 were selected for full review. Only three studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, one showed an incongruence between users' expectations and experiences of device use; another reported perspectives on potential rather than actual device use, ranking design features in order of perceived importance; and the other reported ratings of ease of device use in training.The heterogeneity of studies included within this review, leave the authors unable to suggest consensus as to user perspectives of exoskeleton technology. However, it is apparent that users are able to suggest priorities for exoskeleton design and that users' perspectives of exoskeleton technology might change in response to experience of use. The authors, therefore, suggest that exoskeleton design should be an iterative process, whereby user perspectives are sought, incorporated and refined by tangible experience, to ensure that devices developed are acceptable to and usable by the populations they seek to re-enable.}

Assessing the relative contributions of parent-to-offspring inheritance and gene sharing is a vital step in understanding the evolutionary origins and modern-day function of an organism, but recovering and showing these relationships is a challenging problem. Results. We have developed a new approach that uses linear programming to find between-genome relationships, by treating tables of genetic affinities (here, represented by transformed BLAST e-values) as an optimization problem. Validation trials on simulated data demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in recovering and representing vertical and lateral relationships among genomes. Application of the technique to a set comprising Aquifex aeolicus and 75 other thermophiles showed an important role for large genomes as 'hubs' in the gene sharing network, and suggested that genes are preferentially shared between organisms with similar optimal growth temperatures. We were also able to discover distinct and common genetic contributors to each sequenced representative of genus Pseudomonas. Conclusions. The linear programming approach we have developed can serve as an effective inference tool in its own right, and can be an efficient first step in a more-intensive phylogenomic analysis. © 2010 Holloway and Beiko; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.}

Traditional models of manufacturing would appear to be insufficient at helping the world's 1 billion disabled people in accessing the technologies they require. In addition, many who receive assistive technologies simply abandon them as they do not meet their needs. In this study the authors explore the changing world of design for disability. A landscape which includes the rise of the maker movement, the role of ubiquitous sensing and the changing role of the 'user' to one of designer and maker. The authors argue they are on the cusp of a revolution in healthcare provision, where the population will soon have the ability to manage their own care with systems in place for diagnosis, monitoring, individualised prescription and action/reaction. This will change the role of the clinician from that of diagnostician, gatekeeper and resource manager/deliverer to that of consultant informatics manager and overseer; perhaps only intervening to promote healthy behaviour, prevent crisis and react at flash moments.},

This symposium will be opened by a challenge, laid down by Chapal Khasnabis of the GATE Programme at WHO – what should the AT2030 Programme look to achieve to ensure sustainable service delivery of assistive technology (AT) for all citizens in lower and middle-income countries (LMICs). Catherine Holloway, Research \& Evidence Director of the AT2030 programme will respond to this challenge and share the initial learnings from the AT2030 programme and how these are feeding into the new vision of the ATscale Global Partnership on AT. AT2030 has the ambition to provide Low cost, mass market, life-changing AT for all. It is a £10 investment by the UK Department for International Development. AT2030 will help to lay the foundations for global AT access through finding evidence of what works; testing the user-centred design of technology; trailing new service delivery innovation, and opening market access in priority LMICs. Finally, these will be critiqued by Bishnu Dhungana, who is both an expert in the field of AT and a user of the service herself.}

Propulsion forces, trunk and upper limb kinematics and surface electromyography were recorded during four propulsion tasks (level, 2.5\% cross slope, 6.5\% incline and 12\% incline).  Kinetic and kinematic data were applied to an OpenSim musculoskeletal model of the trunk and upper limb, to enable calculation of glenohumeral joint contact force.  Results demonstrated a strong positive association between propulsion forces and glenohumeral joint contact forces.  Both, propulsion forces and joint contact forces increased, as the task became more challenging. Participants demonstrated increases in trunk flexion angle as the requirement for force application increased, significantly so in the 12\% incline.  There were significant increases in both resultant glenohumeral joint contact forces and peak and mean normalized muscle activity levels during the incline tasks. This study demonstrated the high demand placed on the glenohumeral joint during accessibility tasks, especially as the gradient of incline increases.  A lightweight instrumented wheelchair wheel has potential to guide the user to minimize upper limb demand during daily activity.},

  location = {{United Kingdom}},
  abstract = {There are a growing number of people with mobility impairments who use wheelchairs to get around the built environment. This number is likely to increase in the future due to an increasingly ageing population combined with advances in medical technology which help to overcome some of the barriers to access that have hitherto prevented people from leading as full a life as they would have liked. Footways form an integral part of the transport network and therefore it is essential they can be accessed by all people. Currently, however, there is no well-defined method to measure the accessibility of footways for wheelchair users. One aspect of a footway is the crossfall – the transverse gradient designed to facilitate surface water drainage – which adds to a wheelchair user’s difficulty when progressing along the footway. This paper first reviews previous research on measuring the effect of crossfalls on wheelchair accessibility, highlighting the need for a new approach. It then proposes the Capability Model as a starting point for this new approach. The model is updated and populated with an initial capability set chosen to measure footway accessibility across footways with three different crossfall gradients (0\%, 2.5\% and 4\%).  The focus is on the physical work provided by the user to the wheelchair in order to keep it travelling in a straight line. It is shown that in order to travel in a straight line when a footway is flat only a single principal capability is required:  the ability to produce sufficient force over the required distance to overcome the inertia and rolling resistance and keep the wheelchair moving at the chosen velocity. When a positive crossfall gradient is introduced a second capability is required: the ability to apply different levels of force to the left and right sides of the wheelchair. It is concluded that it is possible to measure these two capabilities and these provide a good insight into the effect of crossfalls on footway accessibility for wheelchair users.},

How will digital methods (4D printing) change how we design, develop and deliver P\&O’s? How will data help drive design? How interactive and responsive will P\&O become? How will an increasing user interaction impact the design process? How will all of this impact the skills gap? We will explore the probable by revealing opportunities and challenges of trialling new products within service through the example of AMPARO which uses material science innovation to transform delivery service of prostheses in Kenya through the AT2030 programme, particularly in the developing world, and then look to the near future. New materials and 4D printing allow us to design bespoke liners which can sense. We will explore what this means for the P\&O sector.

The review includes WHO world region, publication year, AT type and a sector analysis against the Systems-Market for Assistive and Related Technologies Framework. We analyzed the case studies and interviews using thematic analysis. We included 91 papers out of 3,127 after review along with 72 case studies. Our results showed that product innovations were more prevalent than provision or supply innovations across papers and case studies. Case studies yielded two themes: open innovation (OI); radical and disruptive innovation. Financial instruments which encourage OI are needed and we recommend pursuing OI for AT innovation. Embedding AT within larger societal missions will be key to success governments and investors need to understand what AT is and their translational socioeconomic value.},

Despite the proven advantages of AT for disabled and older people, their families, and society, there is still a vast and stubborn gap between the need and the supply; currently only 10\% of those who need AT currently have access to it. This Scoping Research Report on Assistive Technology (AT) seeks to unpick and understand the multi-layered and multifaceted ways in which economic, social, and political factors interplay and interact to create barriers to AT for those who need it the most. Through primary and secondary research, they explore the current landscape, the limitations, and current initiatives, ultimately answering the question: “How best should a target intervention around AT sphere affect positive change for poor, disabled and older people in Global South priority countries?”. To understand this question, the research team asked two specific questions: What are the barriers which prevent access to AT for the people that need it, with a focus on those living in low resource settings within DFID priority Global South countries? How should DFID, in partnership with others best direct its intervention toward overcoming these barriers? The work reveals that, while levels of AT market development vary across countries, key barriers are common. These barriers can be classified into 5 main categories related to both supply and demand factors and across the 5Ps of People, Products, Provision, Personnel, and Policy.

We propose low-level features constructed from the IMU data gathered from 35 participants, while they performed a stair climbing and descending task in a real-world simulated environment. We demonstrate that with these features the machine learning models predict dementia with 87.02\% accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate how system parameters, such as number of sensors, affect the prediction accuracy. This lays the groundwork for a simple clinical test to enable detection of dementia which can be carried out in the wild.}

Participants used a combination of pictures and voice recordings to capture their own stories and illustrate the impact that mobile phone use has on their lives. Through thematic analysis, we categorized the benefits of mobile phones captured by participants as 1) Improved social connection; 2) Increased independence and 3) Access to opportunities. While mobile phones are ubiquitously used for communication, for persons with disabilities they become essential assistive technologies that bridge barriers to opportunities which are not accessible otherwise.

This paper reports on the development and initial feasibility testing of a system for monitoring when and how assistive devices are used outside of the clinic setting, and feeding this information to the device user themselves and/or prescribing clinician (where appropriate). Illustrative data from multiple time-synchronized device and body worn sensors are presented on a wheelchair user and a user of a 'rollator' walking frame, moving along a walkway. Observation of the sensor data in both cases showed characteristic signatures corresponding to individual 'pushes'.

  abstract = {The NanoQEY (Nano Quantum Encryption) Satellite is a proposed nanosatellite mission concept developed by the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) at the University of Waterloo and the Space Flight Laboratory (SFL) at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) that would demonstrate long-distance quantum key distribution (QKD) between two distant ground stations on Earth using an optical uplink. SFL's existing and proven NEMO (Nanosatellite for Earth Monitoring and Observation) bus forms the baseline spacecraft for NanoQEY, with a QKD receiver payload designed by IQC. The primary objective of the NanoQEY mission would be to successfully distribute at least 10 kbit of secure key between two optical ground stations, where the satellite acts as a trusted node. The secondary mission objective would be to perform Bell tests for entangled photons between ground and space. We designed a compact QKD receiver payload that would be compatible with the mass, volume, power and performance constraints of a low-cost nanosatellite platform. The low-cost rapid schedule "microspace" approach of UTIAS/SFL would allow for the proposed NanoQEY mission to be developed in 2.5 years from project kick-off to launch of the spacecraft, followed by a one-year on-orbit mission.},

Wheelchair control is a complex motor task that increases both the physical and cognitive workload. New wheelchair interfaces, including Power Assisted devices, can further augment users by reducing the required physical effort, however little is known on the mental effort implications. In this study, we adopted a neuroergonomic approach utilizing mobile and wireless functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based brain monitoring of physically active participants. 48 volunteers (30 novice and 18 experienced) self-propelled on a wheelchair with and without a PowerAssist interface in both simple and complex realistic environments. Results indicated that as expected, the complex, more difficult environment led to lower task performance complemented by higher prefrontal cortex activity compared to the simple environment. The use of the PowerAssist feature had significantly lower brain activation compared to traditional manual control only for novices. Expertise led to a lower brain activation pattern within the middle frontal gyrus, complemented by performance metrics that involve lower cognitive workload. Results here confirm the potential of the Neuroergonomic approach and that direct neural activity measures can complement and enhance task performance metrics. We conclude that the cognitive workload benefits of PowerAssist are more directed to new users and difficult settings. The approach demonstrated here can be utilized in future studies to enable greater personalization and understanding of mobility interfaces within real-world dynamic environments.},

  abstract = {The majority of people with upper limb absence (PWULA) live in lower, or middle-income countries (LMICs). However, efforts to develop improved prostheses have largely focused on electrically powered devices, sustainable deployment of which, in LMICs, is difficult. In the ‘Fit-for-purpose, affordable body-powered prostheses’ project, teams from the United Kingdom, Uganda and Jordan are developing mechanically-operated prostheses, optimised for LMICs, and establishing local methods for fabrication, fitting and evaluation. Here we first report on preliminary studies aimed at grounding the project in the reality of current prosthetics services and the experiences of people with limb absence in Uganda.  Finally, we outline our ongoing work in the context of our findings.In our first two studies we reviewed current prosthetics and associated repair services. An issue which came up repeatedly was the difficulty faced by orthopaedic technologists in accessing componentry/materials.  All specialised prosthetics components and materials are imported, often at a high cost. Purchasing does not appear to be well coordinated between centres, meaning potential economies of scale are not being fully exploited. Although there is supposed to be government funding for prosthetics, in practice budgets are often inadequate and a reliance on donations is common. The resource limitations mean Orthopaedic Technologists often resort to ad-hoc solutions; unsurprisingly perhaps, failures in prostheses were reported. In particular, lamination-based socket manufacture is very difficult, given the complexity (and cost) of the processes involved. Repair services are also limited, in part also due to problems accessing materials/components. Despite (or in part, as a result of) these challenges, the orthopaedic technologists are generally an extremely  415resourceful and multi-skilled group and there is genuine enthusiasm to see services improve. Further, there is a growth in interest and capabilities in the area of medical device innovation.In the third of our studies, we interviewed 17 PWULA and present preliminary results from the analysis of a subset of five participants. Firstly, we found that only 2 of the participants reported experience with using an upper limb prosthesis, again supporting the picture which emerged from the other studies. The findings illustrate the emergence of four key themes: a) attitude towards disability; b) barriers to prosthesis use; c) coping without a prosthesis; and d) communication with other PWULA.  Although attitudes to those with limb loss varied, participants reported impacts in terms of social isolation and a mixed experience of emotions that appeared predominantly negative; barriers to prosthesis use were broader than just cost and functionality, and included a lack of training and psychological support; given that it is difficult to access an upper limb prosthesis, PWULA have found ways to perform daily life activities without relying on one; finally, most PWULA find the suggestion of communicating with other people with the same experience appealing.In our project we are addressing some of the issues found in the preliminary studies. To make socket manufacture less dependent on access to imported materials and specialised equipment, we are investigating the development of lattice-style, adjustable sockets, made from locally available materials. We are also investigating alternatives to the traditional harness-controlled, body-powered prosthetic hands. Given that clinicians have no objective means of evaluating the value of the prosthesis to their clients, we are testing the use of low-cost digital monitoring tools. We are also exploring the potential value of using mobile-phones to reduce the isolation of PWULA. Finally, we are exploring how these innovations may be translated into the Ugandan health setting.},

The perfect time resolved measurements would ideally involve a single-particle source and an array of single-particle noiseless detectors featuring perfect quantum efficiency and time resolution. In previous experiments for electrons [1], photons [2] and molecules [3], detection of single particles was limited by minimum acquisition times, thus denying access to precise timing information. We make a significant step forward, approaching the perfect measurement very closely and showing real-time interference pattern buildup of singlephoton detections as a result of passing through a system of multiple slits. These measurements accessed precise timing information, allowing us to analyse the interference pattern's formation process and effects of entanglement. © 2013 IEEE.}

Here we present a temporally- and spatially-resolved measurement of the double-slit interference pattern using single photons. We send single photons through a birefringent double-slit apparatus and use a linear array of single-photon detectors to observe the developing interference pattern. The analysis of the buildup allows us to compare quantum mechanics and the corpuscular model, which aims to explain the mystery of single-particle interference. Finally, we send one photon from an entangled pair through our double-slit setup and show the dependence of the resulting interference pattern on the twin photon's measured state. Our results provide new insight into the dynamics of the buildup process in the double-slit experiment, and can be used as a valuable resource in quantum information applications.}

  abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aspire to "leave no-one behind". Universal access to assistive products is a critical link between the realization of the SDGs and those most likely to be left behind. However, assistive technology provision in many countries, particularly low- and middle-income countries, has traditionally been conducted through small-scale local providers, manufacturing products of varying degrees of quality at a limited price range. An effective way to scale these production and provision enterprises to the required level is needed to close the gap between available and required assistive technology. We argue that better access to assistive technology will only be realized through the adoption of a far stronger systems thinking and market shaping approach. We undertook a rapid literature review to explore the relationship between market shaping and assistive technology. Based on our review, we present an emergent framework for conceptualizing intersections between systems thinking and market shaping for assistive technology-the SMART (Systems-Market for Assistive and Related Technologies) Thinking Matrix.}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study employed a qualitative approach to explore the motivations and satisfaction of individuals with lower limb loss engaging with a prosthetic service in Mombasa, Kenya. In-depth interviews were conducted over Microsoft Teams with 10 lower limb prosthesis users and thematic analysis was applied. RESULTS: Five key themes emerged: acceptance, self-determination, hope, clinician relationship and perception. These findings demonstrate the importance of hopeful thinking and a supportive community in overcoming physical and stigmatising challenges. The findings further highlight the value of the service provider relationship beyond just prescribing an assistive device. CONCLUSION: These results have relevance in developing patient-centred services, assistive devices and personnel training that are responsive, motivating, and cognisant of the service user. This is of particular interest as assistive technology services are newly developed in low resource settings.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThis research provides an understanding of lower-limb prosthesis users' satisfaction of a device and motivation for engaging with a prosthetic service within a low resource setting.The relationship the rehabilitation professional has with the service user plays a significant role in facilitating motivation during rehabilitation.Rehabilitation professionals should consider how they can foster a network of support amongst service users when planning services in remote, rural locations.Rehabilitation professionals should be aware of how hopeful thinking can be facilitated during rehabilitation to support motivation.When reviewing the success of services, or designing new service models, the service users should be consulted on what they would deem as a successful outcome.},

In this study, coordinate values of the vector defined on the upper arm were calculated from an inertial sensor attached on the upper arm. Methods of detecting stroke motion and for measuring the push cycle by using this vector were examined. Ten able bodied (i.e. non-wheelchair users) propelled the wheelchair on 10m long level and sloped surfaces. Excluding the first stroke and the braking motions, detection rate of the stroke number was more than 97\% and mean absolute error of the push cycle was less than 30ms on both surfaces.

  abstract = {Although work on exoskeleton technology started as early as in the 1960’s, it is mostly recognized and used as devices to aid in the rehabilitation process  and for military purposes. The use of wearable and portative exoskeleton technology for functional compensation is less well understood for the upper limbs in comparison with the lower limbs. A review of current upper limb exoskeleton technology suggests that there is limited attention to the interaction between the exoskeleton and the human. In order to control or compensate movement, exoskeletons transfer forces through a physical coupling between the device and the human limb (exoskeleton-human interface). This exoskeleton-human interface is a physical coupling that requires the consideration of optimal and safe force transfer (magnitude, direction and locations) as well as user comfort; considerations that have been overlooked by current exoskeleton technology. Before implementing a highly specialized electronic control system between the user and exoskeleton, it is necessary to design a truly wearable, safe and comfortable mechanical structure. The aims of this study are to modify a commercial elbow orthesis by instrumenting it with a control system and force sensors in order to measure the following parameters: dynamic stiffness and pressure between the orthosis and the human skin. This instrumented orthosis is further controlled by the user through a mouth switch. The instrumented orthosis is employed to monitor forces and stiffness during activities of daily life which involve self-care and domestic life for a fully abled person. Upper limb exoskeleton designers could use this data to fabricate technology that exerts forces that are safe and within what the end user considers comfortable. This modified orthosis will be used in a future study in individuals with spinal cord injury from C5 to C8 levels.}

These benefits can be invaluable for people that already have upper limb joint pain and reduced muscular strength. However, it is not clear if the way that assistance is provided by such devices is what manual wheelchair users need and expect. 12 manual wheelchair users were interviewed to understand: the situations in which they find it difficult to propel their wheelchairs; situations they considered paramount to have power assistance; their experience or knowledge of power assist devices; and likes and dislikes of commercially available power assist devices. Finally, they were asked to comment on their ideal form factor of a power assist device. Users have suggested improvements of the devices' accessibility and visualized new ways in which they could interact with the technology. These interactions involve "chairable" devices independent from, but not excluding, wearable devices and mobile applications.

  abstract = {Improvements in electric wheelchair designs have left aside the power source. Electric wheelchair designs continue to use deep-cycle lead acid batteries which are heavy and large. The implementation of new lighter and smaller power sources for portable assistive technology, such as electric wheelchairs, requires the estimation of power demand under different driving conditions. These estimations are not available for electric wheelchairs. The estimation of power demand in the form of power cycles from driving cycles is a common methodology in the automotive industry and critical for sizing the power sources used in propulsion systems. The purpose of this data collection was to to determine electric wheelchair power and driving cycles in simulated standard outdoor conditions adapting a methodology derived from the microtrip approach, which is widely used in the automotive industry. The microtrip method allowed the testing of driving conditions to be examined separately and then combined to form a “typical” wheelchair journey which is presented here as a suggested representative electric wheelchair drive cycle.}

Seventeen adults with upper limb absence were individually interviewed and their interviews were analysed utilising thematic analysis. / Results: Seven themes illustrating the impact on the individual’s life after amputation were identified and categorised into (1) living and adapting to life, (2) productivity and participation and (3) living within the wider environment. This study presents three main findings: (1) PWULA need psychological and occupational support services which are not available in Uganda, (2) PWULA want to work, but face multiple barriers to employment and has limited support, combined with the complex parenting and caring responsibilities, (3) the local Ugandan culture and social structures affect the everyday life of PWULA, both in positive and negative ways. / Conclusion: This study provides information on the lived experiences of PWULA in Uganda which are lacking in the literature. People with upper limb absence face ableism and hardship underpinned by a lack of formal support structures and policies, which may in turn exacerbate the impact of upper limb absence on multiple facets of life.},

  abstract = {Current advances in wearable flexible and elastic sensors show important applications for monitoring skin health and safety where technology is in contact with the human body, such as with assistive technology. However, the availability of these advances has been shadowed by patented techniques and often difficult to reproduce fabrication procedures. Open source knowledge and data acquisition platforms such as Arduino have recently opened the opportunity to transfer technology into low resource settings. This accelerates and facilitates the fabrication and application of tools that can have a significant impact in improving the performance of assistive technology. Similarly, 3D printing offers further opportunities such as being able to print orthoses parts anywhere in the world. Therefore it is desirable to use these “facilitators of knowledge transfer” to create soft skin elongation sensors that will aid in the understanding of the skin-technology interface in settings where this type of technology will otherwise be unaffordable, too complicated to manufacture or impossible to use due to patent infringement issues. The aim of this study was to test various techniques and materials in order to fabricate a soft skin elongation sensor with a flexible connection. 3D printed moulds and a selection of conductive threads, yarns and fabrics were employed to produce and test skin elongation sensor prototypes on thin biocompatible silicon bodies that could be temporarily glued to the human skin. These sensors were also designed to have a flexible connection and be able to communicate to a computer through Arduino. The performance of various soft skin elongation sensors prototypes is presented. These sensors will be useful for characterizing comfort and safe skin stretching where the skin interfaces with technology such as with prostheses, orthoses and exoskeleton technology. Similarly, these skin elongation sensors could be used in humanoid robots for low cost tactile sensing.}

We show the intrinsic links between disability inclusion and the climate crisis, and the particular vulnerability people with disabilities face in its wake. In particular, we discuss how localised circular models of production could be beneficial, facilitating context driven solutions and much needed service elements such as repair and main-tenance. Key discussion areas include systems approaches, digital fabrication, repair and reuse, and material recovery. Finally, we look at what needs be done in order to enable these approaches to be implemented. In conclusion, we find that there are distinct parallels between what AT provision models require to improve equitable reliable access, and strategies that could reduce environmental impact and bring economic benefit to local communities. This could allow future AT ecosystems to be key demonstrators of circular models, however further exploration of these ideas is required to make sense of the correct next steps. What is key in all respects, moving forward, is aligning AT provision with sustainability interventions.},

We present the voltage response characterization of bespoke force sensors made with an active polymer composite, silver coated fabric, stainless steel thread, and silver epoxy. Characterization of the effects of static and dynamic loading was completed with a mechanical testing machine. Static tests consisted of loading and unloading at 0.01, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 N/s, and drift tests for 120 minutes up to 10 N every 1 N. Dynamic tests consisted of a sinusoidal load of 5 N ±1 N applied at 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 Hz for 60 min. The force-voltage relationships were modeled using an exponential function. Maximum mean drift error was observed when applying different static loads for 120 minutes each. Drift error is minimal at 5 s ({$<$}1\%) and at 60 min ({$<$}5\%) with loads under 1 N. Maximum hysteresis of 18\% was observed at the 1 N/s loading rate. The maximum drift error after 1 h of dynamic loading was observed at 0.5 Hz and is minimal (-0.00004\%). The cost of fabricating these sensors is very low compared with commercially available options. These sensors can be fabricated in any shape and size with the added advantage of being able to set the location of the electronic connections as desired.}

Platform edge doors (PEDs) are used in metro stations to improve passenger safety and comfort, while step-free access with a minimum gap between the train and the platform is desirable on the grounds of accessibility. There is little research on the effect of PEDs on boarding and alighting time (BAT) and passenger behavior patterns. Many authors, however, have examined the impact of vertical and horizontal gaps in passengers’ boarding and alighting. On the London Underground, there is always step-free access between the train and the platform when there are PEDs; but even at some platforms without PEDs, level access may be provided by platform humps. This study examined the combined effect of PEDs and level access on the boarding and alighting process. Two London Underground platforms, both with level access, one with PEDs and one without PEDs, were compared by analyzing bespoke video footage. The results showed that PEDs on their own had no overall negative impact on BAT and that, in most situations, they encouraged passengers to wait beside the doors. It was also found that demand (number of boarders, alighters, and passengers on the train) was a more important influence on BAT and passenger behaviors than was the presence of PEDs.}

  abstract = {Platform edge doors (PEDs) have been used in various metro stations to improve safety and ventilation conditions, however limited research has been done to estimate the passenger space (PS) in the boarding and alighting process when PEDs are installed. The aim of this study was to estimate the space needed for boarding and alighting at metro stations. The method was based on a mock-up carriage and the relevant portion of the platform at University College London´s Pedestrian Accessibility Movement Environmental Laboratory (PAMELA), in which different load scenarios of boarding and alighting were conducted. The scenarios were based in a preliminary analysis observed at Westminster Station, in which PEDs are installed. To obtain the position of each passenger on the platform a tracking tool was used. The hypothesis of this research was that PS for alighting passengers can be represented as an asymmetrical ellipse, in which the longitudinal and lateral radii changed according to the negotiation with other passengers alighting or waiting on the platform to board the train. Therefore, there is a relationship between PS and the level of interaction, which suggests that passengers adjust their PS to avoid collision. This research can be used by traffic engineers to estimate PS of passengers boarding and alighting when PEDs are used. This in turn can help in designing the platform train interface (PTI) and platforms at transport infrastructures.},

The interaction time (IT) was adjusted and a multinomial distribution function was used to model passengers based on London Underground stations.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted all segments of society, but it has posed particular challenges for the inclusion of persons with disabilities, those with chronic illness and older people regarding their participation in daily life. These groups often benefit from assistive technology (AT) and so it is important to understand how use of AT may be affected by or may help to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Objective: The objectives of this study were to explore the how AT use and provision have been affected during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how AT policies and systems may be made more resilient based on lessons learned during this global crisis. METHODS: This study was a rapid, international online qualitative survey in the 6 United Nations (UN) languages (English, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Mandarin Chinese) facilitated by extant World Health Organization (WHO) and International Disability Alliance networks. Themes and subthemes of the qualitative responses were identified using Braun and Clarke's 6-phase analysis. RESULTS: Four primary themes were identified in in the data: Disruption of Services, Insufficient Emergency Preparedness, Limitations in Existing Technology, and Inadequate Policies and Systems. Subthemes were identified within each theme, including subthemes related to developing resilience in AT systems, based on learning from the pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has disrupted the delivery of AT services, primarily due to infection control measures resulting in lack of provider availability and diminished one-to-one services. This study identified a need for stronger user-centred development of funding policies and infrastructures that are more sustainable and resilient, best practices for remote service delivery, robust and accessible tools and systems, and increased capacity of clients, caregivers, and clinicians to respond to pandemic and other crisis situations.},

Furthermore there is a need to reduce the overall energy consumption of the device in keeping with the current trends of reducing carbon emissions. The control system for attendants pushing wheelchairs that reduces the energy needed by the assisting device is an increasing trend of optimisation of assistive technology devices to individual capabilities to ensure less energy expenditure of the attendant. The control parameters for existing assisting systems for attendant wheelchair propulsion are difficult to optimise for individual capabilities. We focus on the individual propelling performance, and propose an assisting control method based on the force velocity relationship of the individual. Our proposed assisting controller generates an assisting force when the attendant's propelling force exceeds an assisting boundary defined by the force velocity relationship. In this paper, we tested the performance of the assisting controller based on force velocity (FV) relationship using simulation. The simulation used an attendant wheelchair model with parameters determined from experiments. From the simulated results of the assisting force trajectories, the FV assisting system worked as we defined. The FV assisting system used less energy consumption than the existing proportional assisting systems. Also the FV assisting system would have a limit of maximum attendant propelling power, so the distribution between the attendant force and the assisting force can be easily adjusted to the individual's force velocity relationship. Our proposed FV assisting system would be useful as it would allow an optimised system based on individual capabilities to be created for rehabilitation/training systems, which would allow optimum energy consumption when propelling a wheelchair. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The SenseWheel is a lightweight force-sensing handrim, comprised of three identical load cells. The load cells are interposed between the pushrim and drive wheel. The initial design SenseWheel Mk 1 measured the three orthogonal forces Fx, Fy and Fz, and axial torque Tx, applied at each load cell [2]. It has been constructed, calibrated, and used in a limited clinical trial. SenseWheel Mk1 is: 1) light weight (less than 100g), 2) able to fit s different diameter wheel or hand rim and 3) Waterproof. This paper describes the development of an improved Mk2 version of Sensewheel which uses wireless 6DOF load cells to measure Fx, Fy, Fz, Tx, Ty, and Tz. This will simplify the coupling to the wheel and handrim. Each load cell will transmit its data via Bluetooth to a master tablet/SmartPhone carried by the user or held remotely. Methods: COMSOL was used to redesign the 6DOF load cell, using 8 quarter-bridge strain gauges equi-spaced around the inner circumference of the widest part of the load cell for good strain sensitivity and selectivity. This provided some redundancy in case of non-optimal gauge placement in the actual load cell. Each load cell is 40mm diameter at its widest, to accommodate coin cell, Bluetooth module and flexible printed circuit. The optimum orientation of the gauges was determined using COMSOL Multiphysics® with a 3D axis-symmetric finite element model generated from a 2D cross sectional model. The load cell was designed as two halves, to be screwed together after assembly, and this was modelled in COMSOL as one part. COMSOL was set to output direct strains (eX, eY, and eZ) as well as shear strains (eXY, eYZ, and eZX) in response to applied forces Fx, Fy, Fz, and torques Tx, Ty, and Tz. The strains were calculated at 5 deg intervals along the circumference of the inside wall of the load cell. These strains were then converted from the global axis of the model to the local axis at each strain gauge site using a rotation transformation matrix. The resulting strains were used to investigate both the sensitivity of each gauge to each load type, and also the selectivity of each load type. The gauge angle w.r.t. the longitudinal axis of the load cell was varied, and the strain sensitivities logged. The gauges of one semicircle of gauges were angled opposite the other semicircle to allow for separation between Fx and Mx, as previously used in an instrumented shoulder implant [3]. The correlation coefficient between force/moment pairs was then calculated to predict the optimum angle, which would give best separation between these load types. Importantly, this analysis demonstrated that the strain response, of 8 strain gauges at 45deg intervals around the circumference, to each applied load direction. is clearly distinguishable from the other load types. Results: The peak sensitivity of the strain output by radial position, for several strain gauge angles w.r.t. the longitudinal axis, and the correlation coefficient between same axis force/moment pairs, is shown in Table 1. Figure 1 shows the strains at 5 deg increments around the circumference, for a gauge angle of 45deg, which gave a compromise between good strain sensitivity to each applied load, and adequate selectivity between load types. The designed load cells will now be manufactured, and following assembly each load cell will be calibrated to relate each strain output to each load type applied via a cross-sensitivity matrix, and measured loads are then combined to find the resultant force system on the pushrim. Conclusion: The optimum angle for all gauges was found to be about 45 deg with respect to the longitudinal direction. This provided good sensitivity and separation of force components. Based on this COMSOL analysis, a wireless version of the SenseWheel will be developed, on a mobile platform. A musculoskeletal model is being developed to infer the shoulder forces, to be animated by these pushrim forces. References: [1] Gutierrez et al.

  abstract = {Hand cranking is an alternative method to handrim propulsion for imparting power to a wheelchair. As such it is important that the method does not overload the shoulder or elbow as these joints are at risk of overuse injury in the wheelchair user population. The majority of hand-cycling wheelchair is done under what could be termed ‘autonomous control’. During autonomous control the wheelchair user is travelling at a desired speed and automatically adjusts his or her propulsion/cranking style to the terrain being traversed. Therefore, it is important to understand the loading on the upper limbs during this type of cranking. The experimental system was tested using 3 healthy subjects and the joint powers and torques were measured during the autonomous cranking phase, along with heart rate. From the results it is clear people regulate their hand-cranking in response to increases in heart rate. The maximum cranking power was found to occur at 1.1 rad/s, which produced 3.8W. When the arm was at full stretch from the body (at 180°) the shoulder was working at its hardest. This is because the hand position on the tip of crank is furthest from the shoulder. The elbow was found to be very weak when it travels past 100 ° flexion angle, this means the elbow joint is having to work hard when cranking between 270° to 70°. It is suggested that adapting the cranking position and cranking length could reduce the maximum power requirements on shoulder and elbow. It is also thought that correct gear ratio settings for individual performances could also reduce overuse injury on shoulder and elbow.},

This study introduced a PAPW with force velocity assist control (FVAC) based on individual capability of pushing force velocity relationship. This PAPW assists attendant pushing when more pushing force is needed over usual range of individual physical capabilities of pushing. With the PAPW, we investigated the performance of the FVAC and compared it with proportional assist control (PAC) on a flat level surface and a longitudinal slope (6.5\%) with three participants. The experimental results showed that the PAPW with the FVAC reduced 50\% of pushing force on the slope and this was similar performance of the PAC in terms of assisting. The FVAC also reduced 79\% of mean mechanical assisting power on the flat against the PAC. These results support that the PAPW with the FVAC has flexibilities to adapt to individual physical capabilities and provides certain level of physical activities with sufficient assisting when needed, and low energy consumption for long time and distance operations for attendants.}

The research questions in this study were: 1) How do attendants naturally adapt their walking speed and upper extremity posture when pushing/pulling an attendant-propelled wheelchair? 2) How did this vary with increased resistive loads? 3) What individual differences occurred between participants? When ascending, as the resistive loads increased the wheelchair speeds decreased. The Spearman's rank-order correlation for monotonicity showed was strong, negative correlation between horizontal pushing force and wheelchair speed, which was statistically significant. The maximum mechanical power used by the majority of participants when ascending was approximately 60W at the highest resistive load. The posture learning forward with pushing relatively lower from horizontal direction in ascending, kept joint moments in upper extremity low, up to 60N horizontal force. Over the 60N in horizontal force, the performed pushing force in horizontal direction still kept joint moments low. In descending, the wheelchair speed in most participants did not have clear monotonicity against the increase of the resistive load. Aligned the upper arm and forearm corresponding to the vector of pulling force reduced joint moment in shoulder and elbow. From these findings a model will be established, which can be used in future research to establish how hard different terrains are for wheelchair users and test improvements to the environment as well as the design of the wheelchair.}

  abstract = {Introduction and Aims There is a high incidence of shoulder pain in manual wheelchair users that has been associated with increasing age and duration of wheelchair use. With increasing age, the shoulder joint is more prone to injury due to the biomechanical changes commonly caused by rotator cuff muscle degeneration. The aim of this study was to quantify biomechanical differences between younger and older participants during manual wheelchair propulsion. It was hypothesised that the older group would demonstrate kinetic differences (increased push rate and reduced push efficiency) and kinematic differences (increased change of inclination angle of the humerus and increased relative muscle activity) from the younger group. Material and Methods Two groups of 5 participants (younger and older) with no previous experience pushing a wheelchair completed a pushing test on a wheelchair ergometer. During the test, force imparted at the push rim was measured using the Sensewheel, an instrumented wheelchair wheel measuring with 6 degrees of freedom. The TrignoTM Electromyography system was used to record change in inclination of the humerus and shoulder joint muscle activity. Results The results demonstrated no significant difference between the groups in the kinetic parameters measured. The older group demonstrated a larger change in inclination of the humerus during the test, significantly so in the frontal plane (P = 0.05). Although not statistically significant, the older group demonstrated higher muscle activity during the test, particularly for the Anterior Deltoid and Infraspinatus muscles. Baseline external rotation muscle strength was strongly associated with normalised Infraspinatus muscle activity during the test across both groups (P = 0.04). Conclusion The older group achieved similar kinetic output as the younger group during the wheelchair test. To achieve this required a larger change in inclination angle of the humerus and greater normalised muscle activity around the shoulder. The demonstrated kinematic differences theoretically predispose the older group to shoulder injury during manual wheelchair propulsion.}

  abstract = {Introduction \& Objectives Manual wheelchair propulsion is known to cause shoulder injury, with repetitive joint loading and a high level of muscle activity considered causative factors. High Glenohumeral (GH) joint contact forces during ramp propulsion and weight relief manoeuvres have been reported [4]. Further work is required to investigate the demand placed on the shoulder joint during accessibility tasks including propulsion on cross slopes and ascending bus access ramps. The aim of this study was to develop and test a method of collecting experimental data from wheelchair users during accessibility tasks, to enable calculation of GH joint contact force using OpenSim musculoskeletal modelling software. The methods of data collection chosen reflect the aim to enable analysis of such tasks away from the laboratory setting. Methods An experienced Spinal Cord Injured (SCI) manual wheelchair user (L1 incomplete, 75kg body weight (BW)) attended University College London’s Pedestrian Accessibility and Movement Environment Laboratory. The laboratory houses an adjustable platform which enables the set-up of accessibility challenges similar to those experienced by manual wheelchair users in the built environment. The participant was required to propel a manual wheelchair on a stretch of level paving, a 2.5\% cross slope (wheelchair tilted to the left when moving forwards), 6.5\% incline and 12\% incline. The 12\% incline was set to recreate the length and slope of a London Bus access ramp. Trunk and left shoulder and elbow kinematics were obtained using the XSens MTw system. Euler angles to animate the model coordinates were derived from the rotation matrix that determined the relative position of XSens units on adjacent body segments either side of the joint [2]. Push rim kinetics were recorded on the left side using the Sensewheel, a lightweight instrumented wheelchair wheel measuring 3-dimensional force, and moment about the wheel axle. Measured joint kinematics and push rim reaction forces were applied to an adapted OpenSim model of the upper limb and trunk named ‘Dynamic Arms 2013’, a version of the Stanford VA Upper Extremity Model [1]. The model consists of rigid bodies representing the trunk, upper arm, forearm and hand and was constrained to allow trunk lean, 3 degrees of freedom at the GH joint and flexion/extension at the elbow joint. The actuator set comprised 29 muscles crossing the GH and elbow joints. A reserve actuator was added to the thorax ground joint; otherwise all other model muscle properties were maintained. The model was manually scaled to participant characteristics. The muscle forces required to generate joint torques were calculated using the OpenSim (Version 3.1) static optimisation analysis, which utilises an objective function that minimises muscle activation. The results of the static optimisation analysis were used to calculate shoulder joint contact force during a representative push cycle for each of the conditions. The peak and mean resultant propulsion force and GH joint contact force, and force magnification ratio was calculated [3]. Results The results from the single SCI participant show that increasing peak and mean resultant propulsion force resulted in an increase in peak and mean GH Joint contact force (Table 1, Figure 1). The contact force results for the level condition were similar to those previously reported involving similar propulsion forces [5]. Increasing forces occurred as the slope of the footway increased. Table 1: Push rim forces and GH Joint contact forces during a representative push cycle for a single participant Condition	Level	2.5\% Cross slope	6.5\% incline	12\% incline Peak resultant propulsion force (\%BW)	0.06	0.09	0.16	0.21 Mean resultant propulsion force (\%BW)	0.02	0.03	0.06	0.09 Peak resultant GH Joint contact force (\%BW)	73.1	108.4	185.9	294.0 Mean resultant GH Joint contact force (\%BW)	35.8	57.9	84.6	124.8 Peak force magnification ratio	1463.5	1652.7	1197.5	1447.8 Figure 1: Resultant push rim and GH Joint contact forces from a representative push phase during different conditions for a single participant Conclusion The experimental method used enabled calculation of GH joint contact force during activities representing accessibility challenges for manual wheelchair users. Negotiating the 12\% incline representing the bus access ramp resulted in GH joint contact force 4 times greater than during level propulsion. This indicates that great stress is applied to the shoulder during such activities, potentially leading to injury. Analysis of propulsion during functional tasks to enable optimisation of technique is required. Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the ASPIRE charity for financial support.

With high-density passenger services, large numbers of passengers must be able to board and alight the train quickly - and within scheduled dwell times. Using a specially constructed train mock-up in a pedestrian movement laboratory, the experiments outlined in this paper examine the impact of train carriage design factors such as door width, seat type, platform edge doors and horizontal gap on the time taken by passengers to board and alight. The findings illustrate that the effectiveness of design features depends on whether there are a majority of passengers boarding or alighting. An optimum door width should be between 1.7 and 1.8 m. The use of a central pole and platform edge doors produced no major effects, but a 200 mm horizontal gap could increase the movement of passengers. There is no clear effect of the type of seats and neither the standbacks between 50, 300 and 500 mm. Further research will look for the relationship between the dwell time and the characteristics of passengers such as personal space.}

No such options are easily available for persons with visual impairment (PVIs). As a result, PVIs are often dependent on others for assistance with any activities that require visiting unfamiliar spaces. This seriously constrains PVIs’ social inclusion and ability and right to independently explore their environment. From our earlier studies with experienced PVIs, we explored existing way-finding strategies and the role of environmental cues in aiding orientation and mobility. Here, we build on these findings to propose a route preview assistance application for PVIs to improve building orientation by helping to create a mental representation of spaces they are planning to visit. We translated non-visual cues into potential landmarks and encoded them into a mapping tool - IncluMap. The mapped building data is used to generate an aural route preview. In the follow-up study with five PVI participants, we evaluated how route preview assistance can improve orientation and route knowledge. We show that even for longer routes ({$>$}50~m) with a relatively good number of cognitive landmarks ({$>$}5), participants were able to remember and build a mental map. We found cognitive landmarks were useful for PVIs to support re-localization and getting reassurance in complex indoor spaces. Based on these findings we believe that the proposed route preview assistance can be a useful tool to provide orientation and mobility training to PVIs.},

This results in delays and stress but can also result in sub-optimal treatment or sometimes a complete lack of treatment for the visitors. Sensible physical and digital interventions can greatly ease the experience of visitors and reduce the work-related stress of healthcare providers. We present a case study on wayfinding and service design for a mega ophthalmic care facility that has a daily footfall of 2500 patients. From our mixed-methods study we identified: (i) there are very few accessible mediums available to communicate wayfinding, accessibility, and healthcare information; (ii) there is a lack of inclusively designed interventions to accommodate the diversity of visitors; (iii) spatial ambiguity and situational impairment due to crowd density exasperate the situation and (iv) there exist missing as well as misleading information. We developed a spectrum of solutions on the environmental and digital infrastructures available within this context to deliver wayfinding and procedural information. We completed a progressive intervention across digital and physical mediums over a duration of 18 months. This has shown the impact of each medium on visitors' experience. We found the choice of interface to access information depends on the ease of access, and ease of access depends on visitors' abilities. Therefore, both the environment and digital mediums are found to be useful for visitors. Based on these empirical findings, we draw recommendations for an inclusive service design that incorporates using elements of the environment, human and digital infrastructure to support a more positive healthcare visitors experience.},

These advances are meant to remove physical barriers to entering the bus, but new conflicts have arisen particularly over the physical space aboard. We aimed to research the barriers faced by wheelchair users in public transport using a mixed methods approach to establish the breadth of issues faced by wheelchair users. To this end we quantified the push-force used alight a bus and a study to understand the coping mechanisms used by people to propel up a ramp. This quantitative approach found push forces which resulted in a load of 2 to 3 times body weight being transferred through people’s shoulders, forces which can be directly linked to shoulder injury. This could disable the user further, preventing them from being able to push their wheelchair. Alongside the quantitative study, we conducted qualitative research comprising of a number of in-depth interviews with wheelchair users about the barriers they face in public transport. Our main claim, highlighted through this interdisciplinary collaboration, is that proposed ‘solutions’ to accessibility, such as ramps, often generate problems of their own. These barriers can affect the life of wheelchair users, impacting on their confidence and causing social isolation. These can be long-term in nature or immediate.}

The main experimental research was conducted in collaboration with University College London, using the PAMELA research facility to build a rig of the train and platform for testing with subjects. We also conducted a number of real life observations at train stations within the UK to validate the experimental findings. The research programme also included a literature review and observational study to examine issues around mobility and ageing that affect walking speed and movement around the station. This also used another CCD/HS2 research project that looked at the demographics of the future passenger population and how this would impact on passenger movements. The research programme made a number of recommendations around the configuration of the platform-train interface to optimise boarding times.},

  abstract = {Background: Thermal discomfort amongst lower-limb prosthesis wearers is prevalent with social and medical consequences.  Objectives: This study aimed to verify the feasibility of out of laboratory thermal comfort studies. Study design: Repeated measures pilot study Methods: Thermistors were placed on participants’ residual limbs during two experimental phases. In phase one, mean limb temperature was calculated over a controlled 55-minute rest-exercise-rest protocol. In phase two, participants conducted activities of their choosing wherever they wanted away from the lab, whilst limb temperature data was collected. Descriptive statistics and statistical differences between phases are presented. Results: Five male amputees participated with an average age ± SD of 30 ± 9 years. In phase one, mean limb temperature change ranged between 1.6 ˚C to 3.7˚C. In phase two, mean limb temperature change ranged between 1.8 ˚C to 5.1 ˚C. Limb temperature was significantly higher in out of lab studies (+1.9 ˚C, p = 0.043) compared to in-lab studies. Conclusion: Independent multiple-hour temperature studies are shown to be feasible. Results also indicate that out of lab residual limb temperature can be significantly higher than in-lab temperatures.}

  abstract = {© 2018 American Neurological Association. Objective: Deficits in spatial navigation are characteristic and disabling features of typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD) and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). Visual cues have been proposed to mitigate such deficits; however, there is currently little empirical evidence for their use. Methods: The effect of visual cues on visually guided navigation was assessed within a simplified real-world setting in individuals with tAD (n = 10), PCA (n = 8), and healthy controls (n = 12). In a repeated-measures design comprising 36 trials, participants walked to a visible target destination (an open door within a built environment), with or without the presence of an obstacle. Contrast and motion-based cues were evaluated; both aimed to facilitate performance by applying perceptual changes to target destinations without carrying explicit information. The primary outcome was completion time; secondary outcomes were measures of fixation position and walking path directness during consecutive task phases, determined using mobile eyetracking and motion capture methods. Results: Results illustrate marked deficits in patients' navigational ability, with patient groups taking an estimated two to three times longer to reach target destinations than controls and exhibiting tortuous walking paths. There were no significant differences between tAD and PCA task performance. Overall, patients took less time to reach target destinations under cue conditions (contrast-cue: 11.8\%; 95\% CI: [2.5, 20.3]) and were more likely initially to fixate on targets. Interpretation: The study evaluated navigation to destinations within a real-world environment. There is evidence that introducing perceptual changes to the environment may improve patients' navigational ability.}

  abstract = {How does the presence of a robot affect pedestrians and crowd dynamics, and does this influence vary across robot type? In this paper, we took the first step towards answering this question by performing a crowd-robot gate-crossing experiment. The study involved 28 participants and two distinct robot representatives: A smart wheelchair and a Pepper humanoid robot. Collected data includes: video recordings; robot and participant trajectories; and participants’ responses to post-interaction questionnaires. Quantitative analysis on the trajectories suggests the robot affects crowd dynamics in terms of trajectory regularity and interaction complexity. Qualitative results indicate that pedestrians tend to be more conservative and follow “social rules” while passing a wheelchair compared to a humanoid robot. These insights can be used to design a social navigation strategy that allows more natural interaction by considering the robot effect on the crowd dynamics.}
