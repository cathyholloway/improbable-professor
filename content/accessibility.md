I welcome feeback on how I can make anythign I produce more accessible for you. The contact form or email are probably best for now, whilst I decide on how much I'll use Twitter and if I will move to Mastodon.
 
# Accessibility practices

This site has been designed with the following features in mind:

- A color palette that meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for contrast
- Alternative text for all informative images
- Readable font faces, specifically to avoid impostor letter shapes and mirroring. This site primarily uses Red Hat Text which is freely available and has been found to be relatively accessible to users with dyslexic traits and poor near vision.1
- A table of contents in the blog post sidebar for easier navigation

I care about making this site accessible to all people. I know there will be more I can do. Although my research drives disability innovaiton, I am not a web developer and like many am learning as I go. i reguarly audit this site and welcome feedback on anything I can improve. 

If i fail, I'll write about it and update my Git reposiry with fixes alongside the mistakes I've made.

# Shout out
A quick shout out to @spcanelon who was the first person I found with [a dedicated accessibility page](https://silviacanelon.com/accessibility/) on her #Hugo Apero site, which I have used as inspiration.
