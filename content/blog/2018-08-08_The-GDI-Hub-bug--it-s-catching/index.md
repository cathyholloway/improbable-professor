When you are an academic you learn to roll with the punches. Papers submitted for review come back trashed by reviewers who don’t see the value in the work, or grants are reviewed by people who can only see fundamental flaws before them. You learn to brush yourself off, vent to a colleague and get right back on the bike, so to speak.

Well 2018 is proving to be a little different. I am calling it the Global Disability Innovation Hub Bug. Somehow things are going our way.

GDI Hub Academic Research Centre

We have [launched a new academic centre at UCL](https://www.disabilityinnovation.com/news/how-it-went-ucl-town-hall-meeting-launch-our-research-centre). I am humbled to be leading this, and to be supported by the academic leads at [Loughborough University](http://www.lboro.ac.uk), [London College of Fashion](https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/london-college-of-fashion), [Leonard Cheshire Research Centre](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/iehc/research/epidemiology-public-health/research/leonard-cheshire-research) and the [Helen Hamlyn Centre](https://www.rca.ac.uk/research-innovation/helen-hamlyn-centre/). The launch was a lovely event. To look up at 150 people, all of whom want to help change the world and many of whom have helped support the growth of the GDI Hub already was really a little overwhelming. For anyone who is interested the slides are available here ([link to see slides from town hall meeting](https://www.slideshare.net/CatherineHolloway/town-hall-meeting-final)).

The thing that became abundantly clear from the expert panel discussion was the need for us all to work together to remove stigma, develop technologies and cities inclusively and to evolve the discourse on disability.

Of course, this is just the start. We have a lot to do. A lot more partnerships to build, more research to conduct, more papers (which will no doubt get trashed sometimes) and more grants to write as we build a team capable of tackling the huge societal challenge which is inclusion. What is driving us is how to make a real difference to disabled people’s lives, which can of course only be led by disabled people themselves, so we are simply a tool a mechanism to help accelerate the movement for disability innovation.

The bug spreads

I had written all of the above back in March and never found the time to polish it up and hit publish. The reason I didn’t find the time was that the GDI Hub bug continued unabated, thanks in no small part to the initiative of the Secretary of State, Penny Mordaunt, to call a Global Disability Summit — a Government first. GDI Hub became a hive of activity. Working with DfiD and a great many partners to scope what might be possible if we did something different. What would happen if we tore up the rule book for access to assistive technology and wrote it a fresh?

First off, it turns out that tearing up a rule book takes a lot of time and effort, as does planning a new route forward. We were lucky to have the wisdom and support of the [World Health Organisation’s GATE initiative](http://www.who.int/phi/implementation/assistive_technology/phi_gate/en/), Clinton Health Access Initiative ([CHAI](https://clintonhealthaccess.org)), [Motivation](https://www.motivation.org.uk) and [Leonard Cheshire](https://www.leonardcheshire.org) as we developed and shaped the road forward. We delivered over 100 pages of research (see links below for more details) resulting from two trips to Kenya, one to Uganda, one side meeting at the United Nations Conference of State Parties, over 50 interviews, a great deal of reading and very many sleepless nights.[](https://www.cathyholloway.net/?attachment_id=400)

AT2030 & Atscale

The result was two things: a project and a partnership.

The project is called AT:2030. This £10m investment will transform the assistive technology market place. Globally, as anyone who has ever had dinner with me knows, only 10% of people have access to AT. Thats 900m people without access to wheelchairs, hearing aids and eyeglasses. believe me I could talk about this for a very long time. But instead let its think for a moment about a world where markets work and people have the products and services they need, where disabled people and their communities are developing , and scaling ideas that work and where the mobile phone is transforming how we screen and monitor AT need and usage. This is the world we hope to take a leap towards by 2021.

The partnership — [ATscale](https://atscale2030.org) will transform access and affordability for life-changing AT. We are in good company within the partnership, with [DFID](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development), CHAI, [USAID](https://www.usaid.gov), [WHO](http://www.who.int), [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org) and [Government of Kenya](http://www.mygov.go.ke) amount others.

The aim is that AT:2030 will be one of a number of flagship ATscale projects which will test what works and then ATscale will do just that, scale the solutions to the millions who need them.

So all in all it’s been a busy time, and one this academic will look back on in years to come as a high point. What made it all possible though was, the very many low points that came before it. The grants that didn’t make it, the coffees, the chats, the friendships that helped me to bounce back and keep believing in the ideas. We took all of our old ideas, and we went looking for something wThough those failured ideas had been started and through the rejection we poured in new ways of thinking into the mix, we questioned everything. What came out was something new. I am sure not all of it will work, some parts of AT:2030 will not succeed as well as we hope, but others will, they will soar, and we will have a route to help them go even further through ATscale.

I sign off in hope of the GDI Hub bug continuing for a little while longer.
