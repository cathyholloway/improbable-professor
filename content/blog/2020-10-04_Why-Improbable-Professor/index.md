I am an improbable professor. As a child I certainly didn’t dream of becoming a professor, in fact I don’t think I know anyone who did. When I was young I couldn’t have told you what an engineer did, let alone a professor. And yet here I am a Professor of Interaction Design and Innovation at UCL. Something I feel simultaneously proud of and humbled by.

As I have grown into being a professor I have learned to love my profession. I care deeply about academia, and the future of academia. I care about our role in making the world a better place and I feel people, generally, have no idea what we academics get up to. This means tax payers don’t understand how their money is spent, young people don’t realise it could be a career for them and a multitude of collaboration opportunities with academic institutions go begging. It is for these reasons I want to share my journey and refections on academia.

There is though another reason. I didn’t always believe I could be a professor, even when people told me I could be, but then I didn’t believe I could get a degree, or a PhD or a lectureship or start a business either. I kept doing these things, almost in spite of the voice in my head which kept saying — you don’t belong here. There are many complicated reasons for why I didn’t feel I belonged. Some personal, some societal. But the fact was I didn’t think I was able to do it, and then somehow I had done it.

When I look out into the world, especially within academia, I see a lot of people acting in ways I once acted, nearly believing. I also see ways we could be more inclusive as academics and as institutions. I care that more people who don’t believe they belong in academia feel like they have a home here. And so a part of this blog will be to tell some of my journey to becoming a Professor; the good, the bad and maybe even the ugly in the hope it will inspire others to continue their journey and achieve their dreams.

So two lofty, interconnected aims of this little blog. I hope in a small way to break down a few barriers to knowing what academics do and why working within and with academia is something wonderful when we get it right!

To start with I’ll explore [Academic Failure](http://www.cathyholloway.space/?p=430).
