I can’t touch my toes. I can’t remember ever being able to. But this didn’t stop me enjoying a fabulous 10 days at [Little Cove](http://yogaschoolgoa.com) in Goa. The resort is tiny, run by Pardeshi, a wonderful yoga teacher and a lovely man. His right hand man is Jiuan, who brought me hot lemon and ginger tea each morning as I listened to the sounds of crashing waves and the (less wonderful) crows.

The days followed a wonderful rhythm. First tea. Second, a 2-hour yoga class. Then fresh fruit and more tea. Brunch was served shortly after. We all sat crossed legged eating the most amazing vegetarian food I’ve ever had. It was superb and always served with beams of smiles and a gentleness and calmness I’ve only ever experienced there.

The afternoons were free. I read. A lot. I napped, again, a lot and I lay in the sun or swam around crocodile rock. Fruit and tea were served around two and then meditation, sometimes with light yoga took place at five. It was the perfect antidote to a stressful London year.

So what did I learn?

1.  Regular yoga helps both with a peaceful mind and a more healthy body
2.  I was able to tackle tasks I had been putting off for some time after my break
3.  I need more holidays in my life — I think I’ve only had about 5 holidays since I started working for UCL 10 years ago
4.  I don’t need my phone, or my laptop; at least I need them a lot less than I had once thought
5.  Being healthy (and happy) is much easier when you have a routine
6.  Standing on my head was an easier task than touching my toes!

It’s now been nearly month since I left Little Cove and I have managed to keep up my yoga practice. However, I am still working on trying to find balance in my crazy London Academic life.
