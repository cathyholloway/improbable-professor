I once threw a Tennessee toffee pie at a TV screen having lost yet another game of Street Fighter 2 to my brother, Ed. He was always better at this game, and I ultimately decided it was a silly game. Something I didn’t need or want to play. I had, aged 9, developed a wonderful mechanism to avoid failure. I wouldn’t play. Losing, which was seen in my world as failure, was not something any of my family were good at. We are not good at it at all. But then at the same time, being Irish we are not good at celebrating success. Success is something we can’t be seen to be striving for, it would look as if we had [notions](https://evoke.ie/2017/01/20/style/fashion-fix/having-notions).

So you can’t be full of yourself and failing is a thing to be avoided — this leaves little room for manoeuvre. What I have learnt over the years is that this narrow strip of land I once balanced in is not a great place to hang out. In fact it’s quite suffocating. What is much more fun is the space either side — the one where you are proud and happy to succeed and humble and honest in your failures.

I recently listened to a great episode of How to Fail with [Elizabeth Day](https://howtofail.podbean.com), when she interviewed Andrew Scott, which got me thinking about being Irish and failing. So I thought I would kick my new blog off with some refections on my academic failing thus far.

As a professor, improbable or otherwise, there are three things you need to be able to do: get money (grants), write and publish research papers and teach. I have failed at all three in one way or another!

#### 1\. Publishing papers

There is an old saying in academia: “publish or peril”. However, as an improbable professor I didn’t really see the point of this publishing at first. I had gone to University in Galway and we hadn’t really been exposed to the world of papers. We spent more time in text books or working on designs. I think I had only encountered a handful of papers. Somehow from there to Medtronic where I was an R&D engineer I had been a successful engineer without ever really reading an academic paper. And then I was doing a PhD. You’ll notice here there hadn’t been a master plan. I had sort of just followed my gut asking the simple question — what can I do that will help most?

In answering this question I had meandered into biomedical engineering, through material science and had ended up doing a PhD in biomechanics It didn’t stay in that topic, the more detailed models I did the more I wondered what the point was — I read a lot of economics and thought about the nature of capabilities and the structure of society within which act of pushing a wheelchair happens. You could say I went off track. I would say I was exploring the world. During this time, I read a lot of papers, attended a lot of seminars and talks, talked to my colleagues, ran experiments. I did not write papers.

There were two problems to writing papers: 1) I would need to stick to an idea long enough to write about it and 2) I would need to believe what I had to say was worthy of being written. There was a third — dealing with the inevitable reviewer comments, but that was a distant land I was unaware of for most of my PhD.

#### Didn’t publish, nearly periled

I failed to publish a single journal article during my PhD, worse I failed to write a single journal article. I did actually write some quite good conference papers, which could easily have been journal papers if I had just had the confidence to go with them. As it was I submitted them to what was probably the wrong audience, and whilst they were accepted, I missed the opportunity to present to people who really got what I was trying to do. I now publish quite a lot, and it turns out I love to write. So how did I get from there to here?

#### Finding my audience

Well first I found my audience — I found the people who got what I was trying to do. I am an _undisciplined_ researcher. By this I don’t mean without the resolve to persevere, quite the contrary. Instead, I mean I work on problems which cross multiple boundaries so much so that they are impossible to even split into component disciplines. However, when I go to write I need to make these undisciplined thoughts have a home, they need to be delivered in such a way that specific disciplines get them, to do this I need to speak the language of multiple disciplines and know which story to tell to whom and how to sculpt the story so that it speaks to the people I wish to hear it.

This is not the way many people think of publish or peril, but it is the way I have chosen to think about it; and with this approach I have turned from unpublished to published and enjoyed the journey.

It wasn’t quite that easy. I also had to realise all the ways in which I sabotaged my writing. First was taking on too many new things before I finished the older ideas out. Second, I gave away way too many of my ideas only for others to do a slightly different job of them, but leaving no space for me to weave in my narrative. Third, I needed to be more confident. I did this by changing my environment.

#### Life after a breakdown (note not a failure)

When I realised after my breakdown (more on this another time) that I wanted to stay in academia, I realised I needed to change research ‘homes’. It was then, by genuine chance, I found [UCLIC](https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk). I moved from sitting within accessibility research in transport to human-computer interaction. Making this move was not at all obvious and if I hadn’t very recently had a breakdown I don’t think I would have been able to see the opportunity.

When I joined UCLIC I had no idea how lucky I was. It’s not a perfect research group, it’s not some sort of writers paradise. It is however an environment where people share and develop their thinking together. A place where I have found many good friends and brilliant people. It’s also a place where people strive to be the best they can be and to help one another be their best. In UCLIC I found my voice and the confidence to write and publish.

> The lesson is to know your audience and believe you have something to say, and you do; everyone does.

#### 2\. Grants — my spectacular desk rejection

Having joined UCLIC, I felt under pressure to bring in some money. So I worked with two colleagues on a grant, which we believed had great merit. (Incidentally the grant was to harness digital fluency and making to develop better assistive technologies). Having spent several weeks sculpting our argument, finalising costings and letters of support we hit submit and crossed our fingers. We then, probably moved onto some marking, or other teaching related activity which we were behind in.

Months passed, and when colleagues started receiving reviews from their submissions we were surprised to find we had none. Inboxes were triple-checked only to find there were no comments, nothing to rebuke, no questions to answer.

I wrote to the funding body to ask what might have happened. The answer was something I didn’t understand. The grant had been — ‘desk rejected’. Whatever that meant. It meant, the funding body believed the application had “ no engineering question to answer”. They therefore didn’t even send it for reviews. Quite a spectacular failure in grant writing!

I learnt a lot from this.

First — don’t forget to mention the engineering when you are selling the impact! Second, really don’t forget the engineering! However, it also got me thinking.

The reason my engineering question had been vague is that we really didn’t know _exactly_ what it would be. We had hunches, but we were not sure. We needed some money to go after the hunch. **However, I had failed to explain enough of the hunch, with enough technical details to convince the funder this was their problem to answer.** I now know this is my weakness I make sure this is front and central on each new grant application. However, as with all failure there was future success. I re-used a lot of the material for our [GDI Hub](http://www.DisabilityInnovation.com)’s £19.8m project called [AT2030](http://www.at2030.org) which is funded by [FCDO](http://www.dfid.gov.uk).

> The lesson is to know your audience, and make sure to convince each funder they are the right body to fund answering the question.

#### 3\. Teaching

Teaching is the area where I feel I fail most frequently. I find it very hard. I could list a whole load of excuses here as to why. But, ultimately I think it is because I always want to achieve more than is possible within a term and with the time I have available.

#### The performance of lecturing

I also completely underestimate the emotional energy which goes into lecturing. It is a performance, one which is loosely scripted. I am the central character. I see my job as getting more characters into the story. By this I mean more students engaged in the the material. But this is harder than it seems. It still takes me hours to prepare for a lecture even if I have given it many times before. I never sleep well the night before I lecture and then I give everything I have only to crash afterwards. This is in part because I am an introvert (despite what people might think when I am mid lecture).

Despite my seemingly constant cycle of teaching failures, it is the most important and exciting part of my job. I care deeply about getting better. So for the record (and for me to return to later this year) here are what I believe I currently fail at in my teaching:

*   Getting the level of support right to enable independence in research within my students
*   Managing the bureaucracy — ethics, risk assessments, returning marks, checking attendance, the general admin.
*   Thinking any lecture ever goes well
*   Giving enough feedback at the right time
*   And thanks to COVID-19, teaching design skills, especially co-design online!

I’ll happily take some advice on strategies to overcome these.

Comments and thoughts welcome on any of the above and especially welcome on strategies to improve student online teaching experience!

#### Resources

If you need some help with writing I recommend these sites

*   [ThinkWrite](https://www.thinkwrite.biz/downloads) — free resources to plan papers and theses. If you have a chance to attend a workshop by these guys do!
*   [Cathy Mazak](https://www.cathymazak.comhttps://www.cathymazak.com) has some great resources (and I hear) courses for to help womxn publish more and thrive in academia
*   Growing confidence is always tricky but I find [Brene Brown](https://brenebrown.com) a good place to start.
