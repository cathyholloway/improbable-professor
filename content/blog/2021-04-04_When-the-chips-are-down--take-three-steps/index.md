I’ve always believed it is not how you act when things are going well, but when you are down and out, when things (time and time and time again) go against you, that define you as a person. It’s been months since I wrote the last [ImprobableProfessor](https://www.cathyholloway.space/improbable-professor/) blog. Like nearly everyone I know these past few months have been a really hard time. Harder in ways almost imperceptible, but somehow building to a sort of chronic exhaustion. In those moments when students complained that things were not better and I, yet again, spend days reprofiling mystical possible cuts. When I looked around at the damage being done by decision after decision world wide which didn’t really seem to help those most in need. Not really, not tangibly. In fact, I am sure of what we will see when the dust settles and we all go back to our lives of split commutes and zooms, (if we allow ourselves to pause). At that moment we will see the poor got poorer; those who are not white suffered greater losses; and those who were very rich, and who knew the powerful, got yet richer and more powerful. And so through the months of what I can only call ‘Extreme Work’, since October last year, it has not been the work, or the students, but the feeling that as things got dark, that we didn’t do our best, that we didn’t help the people most in need, that we allowed fear and selfishness and greed to decide our future. And that future will be the worse for those decisions. The question then becomes how to keep going, keep trying to make the world a fairer place when the chips seem intolerably stacked against a more progressive future.

First, and most obviously realise what you have. I am lucky. I am a white woman in a great job working with great people. This helps. As does having a stable and loving home life and good friends to call on to vent too. However, this feeling that it is worse for other people has in my past only got me so far. Because yes it is worse for a great deal more people than me, many, many more. And yes as my Father told me many decades ago I am lucky as I am being born at a time when being white and Irish and a woman I can be accepted anywhere. (This of course has not always been the case; and still isn’t Dad if we are entirely honest, but it is much better than it was say 50 years ago when my grandparents came from Ireland to signs of “No blacks, no dogs, no Irish” on doors). But the world turns on keeping people apart, developing tribes which are then easily manipulated by the wonderfully easy mix of fear and greed and algorithms to turn against one another. People I know, themselves immigrants voted and would still vote for Trump so that they can cling to their newfound wealth and freedom. Of course at the expense of those who would come later or would appear different to them. I despair sometimes when I see this pattern repeat, with politicians and the media, the powerful and the wealthy so easily turning hope into distrust. It’s easy to think you might be going mad, am I the only one who sees this? Of course I am not, I am just lucky. I am lucky in part because of the generation I was born into, in part because of my white skin and free state education all the way to university which allowed me to develop, and in part because I have spent a lot of time and hard work in trying to understand myself and other people.

In a recent conversation with my partner we were pondering things we researched or cared most about, topics we would like to explore more. I can’t remember the exact context to be honest but I do remember something I wrote down, which was unexpected to me. I wrote human nature — that is what I want to understand more. It is human nature which is uniquely remarkable on this planet. When reading [The Ten Types of Human](https://dev-www-65.penguin.co.uk/books/110/1109490/the-ten-types-of-human/9780099592549.html) — a book I highly recommend — there is a wonderful if harrowing description of a young boy Anthony a victim of child slavery who dived into the deep Lake Volta ahead of his co-worker and friend Michael. He dives and dives and dives because he can give something with each dive, life. Anthony empathises with Michael’s fear and gives what he can to alleviate it. When he dies, which seems from the book the enviable fate of all 20,00 children who are forced to dive into lake Volta for fish his life will have meant something; he will have saved one Michael.

This brings me to my second way of dealing with things when the chips are down. To look for the things you can influence and change. Just focus on one small thing. Do it. Repeat. Do the next thing. There are a plethora of books out there telling you how to set goals and repeat habits to achieve those goals. But I am not talking about striving for a goal, or maybe I am, but the goal I am thinking of is survival. When you are so tired and so exhausted and feel so helpless and unable to affect any change in your life, or anyone else’s, that you feel you might as well stay in bed, or just curl up where you are. In those moments, you need to put one foot in front of the other, small steps are fine, just take them. Steps I’ve taken over the past few months have been so simple. Just start the powerpoint, just decide on one reading for that class.

Yes there is a whole course, and yes your diary is totally full with budget problems and staff meetings and talks and possibly if you are lucky an actual bone fide research project meeting (rather than a meeting about managing a project — oh there is a lifetime of difference between these things). Yes the diary is full for the next 12 hours and yes you promised to take the evening off, and yes there is some family emergency brewing and yes the only thing you really need to do is plan that lecture. But if the budgets are really going to be cut in half and if that does mean redundancies than really you should understand the ramifications and review the budgets first, and the staff meeting will have new regulations for teaching and so that is important too and the management meetings are needed as everyone needs more support whilst working from home and so no you can’t cancel anything, and yes this is the 20th day in a row, or is it 100th day in a row this has happened and will you ever have time for that lecture? Breathe. Just do one thing — just decide on the reading, that is all for today. You can of course supplement Lecture with ‘Paper Writing’ or a ‘Phd-you-need-to-read’ or anything else which you are sure as an academic is part of your Main Job, but somehow only seems to happen between the hours of 7pm and 7am no maybe how hard you try. So in those moments, small things help.

Of course one small step at a time will lead you no where fast, but it does keep you going. It keeps your head above water long enough to ask for some help and to block out time for your day job as you see it. So my third and final piece of advice for what it is worth is — now, right now block random slots in your diary for the rest of the year and ask a friend for help in setting some realistic goals for that time. If it helps invite a friend/colleague to a meeting which occurs every two weeks called Project Sanity or anything else you think makes sense and in that two-hour meeting slot you can have cameras on or actually meet or just check in for five minutes and then have a whole two-hours to work on your sanity project list. In my experience a sanity project list is best achieved in conversation with a good friend and colleague. Someone who can tell you if what is on the list is actually the things which will satisfy your desire to have made the world a little bit better. Of course they will be aligned to your work, I don’t know a single academic who doesn’t have their whole life in some way or other aligned to their work — but they will be things you really care about. These are things you would tell someone at the end of your career about, the things that make you feel warm inside and proud. We need these things, or at least I do, as otherwise it is very easy to feel like a hamster on a wheel, which is turning the bigger wheel above you, which is turning a yet bigger wheel, which is turning the world; and as that world spins powered by all us humans it is turning into a place that we are not proud of. And so by keeping your sanity project list and by achieving your small steps you can try to stem the wheel and begin to turn the world to a slightly better direction. Perhaps all the wheels won’t turn in unison, and that is to be encouraged. More debate, new directions, new actors rising, this is what we need. Then maybe in time we will have new voices being heard, perhaps hopefully leading us in a more democratic version of the world. A world in which pandemics can bring us closer together, not further apart, and when we can honestly say we helped those most in need regardless of where they were or how they came to be there, despite the colour of their skin, their gender or their abilities. In short we [build back fairer](https://www.health.org.uk/publications/build-back-fairer-the-covid-19-marmot-review) (thank you Michael Marmot).

My project over the next week is to develop my sanity project list for the next 12 months, and to reflect on which of those meetings I really need, and which are only getting in the way of me playing my part in making this world a fairer and happier place. I might also just sit and allow myself to feel proud of having survived these past few months, having done my best even when running on empty for a very long time.
