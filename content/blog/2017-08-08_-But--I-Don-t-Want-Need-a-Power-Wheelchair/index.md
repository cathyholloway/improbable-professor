The latest paper from my research group is out and will be presented at [ASSETS 2017.](https://assets17.sigaccess.org/program.html) We wanted to understand the attitudes to power-assist wheelchairs. The paper is co-authored by [Dafne](https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/people/dafne-zuleima-morgado-ramirez). You can read it [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318990175_But_I_Don%27t_WantNeed_a_Power_Wheelchair_Toward_Accessible_Power_Assistance_for_Manual_Wheelchairs?_iepl%5BviewId%5D=mw1YIi8LydQL3q0jevgMkq9r&_iepl%5BprofilePublicationItemVariant%5D=default&_iepl%5Bcontexts%5D%5B0%5D=prfpi&_iepl%5BtargetEntityId%5D=PB%3A318990175&_iepl%5BinteractionType%5D=publicationTitle).

We interviewed 12 manual wheelchair users to understand when and where they find propelling their wheelchair difficult. We asked when they need power-assist, and how commercial products fit their needs.

We found that there is an emotional element to the need for power-assist. We also found the need for an open source do-it-yourself wheelchair propelling assistance device. This could help people in both developed and developing countries.

The paper is part of the [EPSRC funded Power-Up! project](https://www.uclicpower-up.com/#intro) which has just finished, but not before the results were captured in an innovation snapshot at the World Health Organization’s [GREAT Summit](http://www.who.int/phi/implementation/assistive_technology/great_summit/en/) (Global Research, Innovation, and Education in Assistive Technology).
