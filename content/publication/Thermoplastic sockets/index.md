# Overview
This paper is part of the [AT2030 Data & Evidence Cluster](https://at2030.org/data-and-evidence/) to support the base of evidence for AT innovations wishing to enter the market place which are being supported by the [AT2030 Innovation Cluster](https://at2030.org/innovation/).  

In this paper, we evaluated the satisfaction and the performance of a transtibial prosthesis featuring a novel socket - the Confidence Socket. This is a rare example of a clinical trial of a direct manufacture socket wihtin an low- and middle-income country (LMIC) context.

# Learnings
The Amparo Confidence Socket represents a potentially viable alternative to improve access to appropriate pros-
thesis in Kenya, but some aspects of usersâ€™ self-reported satisfaction should be further investigated
