excerpt: "Functional limitations become more prevalent as populations age, emphasising an increasinglyurgent need for assistive technology (AT). Critical to meeting this need trajectory is understandingAT access in older ages. Yet few publications examine this from a longitudinal perspective."

# Overview
This paper is part of the [AT2030 Data & Evidence Cluster] (https://at2030.org/data-and-evidence/) of work. Within this cluster, we seek to understand the need for assistive technology within populations. This would help governments plan service provision and innovators look for opportunities. It could also help grow the disability innovation sector. 

In this paper, we were interested in understanding what we could learn from existing data sets of ageing people. As we all need assistive technology as we age, this population is important to our modelling work.

This review identifies and collates what data exist globally. We included population-based cohorts and repeated cross-sectional surveys available in the  Maelstrom Research Catalogue (searched May 10, 2022) and the Disability Data Report (published 2022). Datasets incorporating functional limitations questions dedicated to assistive technology, with a wave of data collection since 2009, were also included.

# Learnings
1. People who use AT from an early age are often excluded from cohort studies. This means there will be an underrepresentation of AT users in population surveys. 
2.  Most cohort data are from high-income, English-speaking countries that have already
aged considerably (27/58, 47%), which restricts their international relevance and highlights the need for cohorts
from diverse contexts when studying inequities in healthy ageing trajectories. 
3. Almost 75% (34/47) focused ÃŸall or in part on participants over 65, which restricts investigations of
how health at younger ages affects healthy longevity.
