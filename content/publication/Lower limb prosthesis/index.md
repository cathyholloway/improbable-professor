# Overview
This paper is part of the [AT2030 Data & Evidence Cluster](https://at2030.org/data-and-evidence/) of work. Within this cluster, we seek to understand the need for assistive technology within populations. This would help governments plan service provision and innovators look for opportunities. It could also help grow the disability innovation sector. 

In this paper, we were interested in understanding the personal and system factors that motivate and enhance outcomes for patients accessing a prosthetic service and using a lower-limb prosthesis within a low resource setting.

# Learnings
This research provides an understanding of lower-limb prosthesis users’ satisfaction of a device and motivation for engaging with a prosthetic service within a low resource setting.
- The relationship the rehabilitation professional has with the service user plays a significant role in facilitating motivation during rehabilitation.
- Rehabilitation professionals should consider how they can foster a network of support amongst service users when planning services in remote, rural locations.
- Rehabilitation professionals should be aware of how hopeful thinking can be facilitated during rehabilitation to support motivation.
- When reviewing the success of services, or designing new service models, the service users should
be consulted on what they would deem as a successful outcome
