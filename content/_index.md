title: "Improbable professor"
subtitle: "Home of Disorganised Leadership"
description: "A personal site of Prof Cathy Holloway. I am a neurodivergent academic with a few mental health challenges. Learning to lead within the highly competitive, and often highly ordered world of academia has been challenging. It's nearly broken me. I want others to have an easier ride, to learn to trust their disroganised instincts and to help more improbable professors thrive within the world I love."
